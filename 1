<p>Open your preferred image editing software. We provide templates that are compatible with Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator.</p>

<ol style="line-height: 19.999px;">
	<li>Create an image on a 1080 by 2340 pixel large file with a transparent background, or use one of the templates we provide&nbsp;<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/on-demand-geofilters/geofilter-templates.zip">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Create your Filter design. Remember to leave enough free space available so Snapchatters can still see their image content behind the design. (We suggest you only use the top or bottom 25% of the screen - remember Snapchatters want to see themselves in a selfie!)&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Save your Filter from the File menu using &lsquo;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Save&gt;Save for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 700;">Web</span><span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;(Legacy)</span>&rsquo; and select the &lsquo;<span style="font-weight: 700;">PNG-24</span>&rsquo; preset from the drop down menu. Make sure you save your image as a PNG so the background is transparent. It&rsquo;s important to create a Filter with a transparent background so Snapchatters&rsquo; photos and videos can still be seen when the Filter is in use.</li>
	<li>Upload your Filter using our&nbsp;<a href="http://create.snapchat.com">&#39;Create Your Own&#39; tool</a>.</li>
	<li>Select your start and end dates and times.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Draw your Geofence! It should cover the relevant area. Please keep in mind Filters work by using a few location indicators to determine where a Snapchatter is and then showing all available Filters in that area. To learn more about how we determine your location please go&nbsp;<a href="https://www.snapchat.com/privacy">here</a>.&nbsp;Unfortunately, sometimes accuracy isn&rsquo;t exact, so it&rsquo;s important to create a Geofence that doesn&rsquo;t use too many points or thin areas. A Filter cannot cover more than 5 million square feet.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Enter your payment information and submit your Filter.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Now sit back and relax, you just submitted an Filter! Our team will be in touch as soon as possible.</li>

        Tap '<strong>Clear All</strong>' on iOS or tap '<strong>Continue</strong>'

        (Clearing your cache won’t delete any of your Memories, Snaps, or

    <p>
      If you’ve already tried freeing up device storage and your Memories are

<p><strong>I can&rsquo;t restore my Snapstreak in the app.</strong></p>

<p>If you still can&rsquo;t restore your Snapstreak in the app, you can try requesting a restoration on our support site by filling out <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/requests/new?co=true&amp;ticket_form_id=149423">this form</a>. Not all Snapstreaks are eligible to be restored if too much time has passed or if the Streak was less than 3 days long, so there&rsquo;s a chance your Streak still may not be restored after submitting a request.</p>

<p>The European Digital Services Act (DSA) is a new regulation in the European Union (EU) that regulates certain online services provided to European users. The DSA has different requirements, depending on the size of the company and type of online service. It subjects larger platforms with more societal influence (known as &lsquo;very large online platforms&rsquo;) to stricter regulations.</p>

<p>Snapchat is currently one of several platforms designated as a &lsquo;very large online platform&rsquo;. The DSA requires Snapchat services that host user content to meet certain requirements. Additional requirements apply to Snapchat services that allow users to share their content with the public.

<p>To reactivate your account, log in to the Snapchat app with the username of the account that you want to bring back. You have 30 days to reactivate a Snapchat account that has been deactivated before we start the account deletion process.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: You cannot change your password or use your email address/phone number to log in to your account while it&rsquo;s deactivated. Permanently deleted accounts cannot be reactivated.</p>

<p><strong>⚠️&nbsp;When will my account/data be fully deleted?</strong></p>

<p>If you choose to delete your account, it will first be deactivated for 30 days. If you change your mind within this timeframe, your account can be reactivated by logging in. After those 30 days, the account will no longer be recoverable, and we start the account deletion process. This means that your account, including settings, friends, Snaps, Chats, Memories, device data, and location data, will be permanently deleted.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: Some deleted account data is retained for legal, security, and business needs. For example, we&rsquo;ll retain information about any purchases you may have made through Snapchat, and when you accepted our <a href="https://snap.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
